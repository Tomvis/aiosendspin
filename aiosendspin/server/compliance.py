"""Client spec-compliance signalling.

The server tolerates a range of non-spec-compliant client behavior for
backwards compatibility. Every such tolerance is funnelled through
``SendspinClient.flag_noncompliance`` / ``SendspinConnection._flag_noncompliance``,
which log the deviation (once per reason in lenient mode) and, when the server runs with
``allow_noncompliant_clients=False``, raise ``ClientComplianceError`` to reject
the client. Grep for those helpers to enumerate the workarounds.
