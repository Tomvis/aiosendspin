"""Visualizer role implementation for the `visualizer@v1` wire.

Each binary message carries exactly one frame of one type. The role emits:
- `loudness` (msg 16) — per audio chunk
- `beat` (msg 17) — fed in via `append_beats` from offline analysis
- `f_peak` (msg 18) — per audio chunk
- `spectrum` (msg 19) — per audio chunk
- `peak` (msg 20) — per audio chunk when the onset detector fires
- `pitch` (msg 21) — per audio chunk when a confident pitch is detected, only
  on connections whose hello carried the pre-#195 stream configuration
  (deprecated: the spec reserves type 21)

`beat` is *deferred* from `stream/start.types` until the first non-empty
schedule actually lands. While beats are still being computed upstream
the role advertises only the FFT-driven types so clients can render a
`peak`-based fallback without flicker; once `append_beats` first
delivers, the role re-emits `stream/start` with `beat` added and beats
begin riding the wire interleaved with periodic frames.

All beats drain through `on_audio_chunk` (audio chunks are delivered to
this role's `on_audio_chunk` regardless of negotiated types), so no
separate clock-based scheduler is needed.
